## The Interactive Interface to figure out your height compared to a creature!
The interface uses ARUCO proxemic markers and Google's MediaPipe gesture recongizer to create a fun interactive interface for you to use on small models / children.

Simply place the marker with id 45 at the top of them item, and the marker with id 90 at the bottom, and get the approximated size based on a real animal. Animal height data gathered primarily from https://www.dimensions.com/browse/animals?6c3303e6_page=2

To use, give camera permission to your browser and have the markers accessible. 
I hope you enjoy!

Right now the interface works on 83mm markers, and therefore (on my camera) you cannot go too far back. Will potentially update to work with larger markers so larger scales can be attained. 

TODO: Create assets for all the possible animals. So far have everything from bug to Alpaca drawn. Will likely need more time for the last 20ish... maybe will insert placeholder images.
